# Keycloak-Admin-OpenAPI-Specification

A tool to autogenerate an [OpenAPI
Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)'s Admin API by scraping the [API
documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/9.0/rest-api/index.html),
in order to create [specifications](keycloak/).

## Licensing

derive from it is licensed under [Keycloak's Apache 2.0
license](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
Anything Keycloak derived shall be placed in a top-level `keycloak`
folder and carry its license.
